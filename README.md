# AI-Powered Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translation System 📌 Overview

Millions of hearing-impaired individuals in India face communication barriers due to the lack of Indian Sign Language (ISL) support in education, workplaces, healthcare, and public services. This project presents an AI-powered real-time ISL translation platform that converts sign language gestures into text or speech, enabling seamless communication without relying on human interpreters.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Limited awareness and adoption of ISL create social isolation, reduced educational access, and fewer job opportunities for hearing-impaired individuals. Human interpreters are costly and not always available, making everyday communication difficult. There is a strong need for an affordable, scalable, and real-time solution to bridge this communication gap.

## 💡 Solution

The proposed system uses computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing to recognize ISL gestures and translate them into readable text or spoken language in real time. The platform is designed to be inclusive, user-friendly, and accessible even in low-connectivity environments.
